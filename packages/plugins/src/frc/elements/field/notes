Field2d
-------

- Field2d should look at /SmartDashboard/Field by default
- Field2d should loop through /SmartDashboard/Field and render each entry as a field object
- Each field object is an element
- Add an option to hide children and show child properties in parent
  - Properties are then named after element (e.g. "Field Object Properties")
- Combine Sources into properties
