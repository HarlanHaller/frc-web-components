Dashbord Interface
==================

The dashboard interface has two modes:

#. **Edit Mode**, which is used to editor dashboards and create new ones.
#. **Live Mode**, which is used to interact with your robot using the dashboard you created in *Edit Mode*.

You can toggle between **Edit Mode** and **Live Mode** by pressing **Shift+E** on your keyboard. In **Live Mode** only the **dashboard area** is visible:

In **Edit Mode** the **dashboard area** and the **dashboard editor** are visible:

The border that separates the **dashboard area** and **dashboard editor** can be dragged to change the size of the areas. This is useful if you want to increase the editor size or if you want to hide it to reveal components that might be hidden behind it:

Selecting nodes
---------------

In order to add, edit or remove nodes, they must be selected in **Edit Mode**. Nodes can be selected by either clicking on them in the dashboard or the **node tree**. The **node tree** is at the top of dashboard editor below the menu:

Each row in the **node tree** represents a different node added to the dashboard. A node is the parent of the node indented below it (the children). A node's children can be expanded and collapsed by clicking on the arrow on the left side of the node tree:

Removing Nodes
--------------

Selected nodes can be removed by pressing the delete/backspace key or by clicking the **Delete Node** menu item in the **Edit** menu:
